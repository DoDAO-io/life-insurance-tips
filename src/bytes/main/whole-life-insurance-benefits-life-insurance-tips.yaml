      date. It lasts until you pass away or terminate it. Premiums build cash
      value that can be accessed under certain conditions.

      Whole life insurance offers price stability with a guaranteed death
      benefit and fixed premiums throughout the contract. As long as premiums
      are paid on time, the cost remains constant, providing assurance against
      increases due to later-life health conditions.

      to the initial contribution.

          - B
        explanation: >-
          Whole life insurance policies offer significant tax benefits. The cash
          value of your policy is not taxed as it grows. Additionally, if you
          withdraw money when you're in a lower tax bracket, it would be taxed
          at a lower rate than when it was originally paid into your account.
