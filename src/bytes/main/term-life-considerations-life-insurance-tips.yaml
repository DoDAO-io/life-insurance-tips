      After determining the coverage amount, you need to decide the tenure of
      the policy. It should not be too short, risking the policy to lapse before
      your financial obligations are completed, or too long, leading to higher
      premiums.

      Term life insurance plans offer affordable riders for added protection,
      including accidental death payout, critical illness, and premium waiver
      for disability. Consider these, even if not immediately needed, due to
      their low cost.

      Lastly, it's important to research the reputation and financial stability
      of the insurance company. Look for reviews, ratings, and customer feedback
      to ensure reliability. Also, read the fine print of all the add-ons as
      they tend to be different for different insurance companies.
