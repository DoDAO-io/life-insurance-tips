      Group life insurance, provided by employers, associations, or labor
      organizations, is a cost-effective or complimentary benefit for members or
      employees. It often offers modest coverage, doesn't mandate a medical
      exam, and involves no individual underwriting.

      The policy is a single contract that covers a group of people. By
      purchasing this insurance on a wholesale basis, companies can secure lower
      costs per employee than if they were to buy individual policies.

      Members receiving this coverage may not have to pay anything out of pocket
      for the benefits. However, if they choose to take more advanced coverage,
      they may opt to have their portion of the premium deducted from their
      paycheck.

      Just like regular insurance policies, insured parties must list one or
      more beneficiaries before the policy takes effect. The typical group
      policy is for term life insurance, often renewable each year during a
      companyâ€™s open-enrollment process.

      In group life insurance, the employer holds the master contract for staff
      or members. Employees opting for coverage receive a certificate, crucial
      for securing individual coverage if they leave the organization.
