      Choosing a term life insurance plan requires understanding that with
      shorter terms, like 5 years, rates increase upon renewal which is a common
      mistake many people make. Opting for longer terms, such as 10 or 20 years,
      keeps rates constant, saving you money over the entire duration.

      Another common mistake is not reviewing your policy annually. The
      circumstances that were true when you first bought your life insurance
      policy may change over time. Therefore, it's crucial to review your
      coverage yearly to ensure it still meets your family's current needs.

      Failing to disclose pre-existing conditions such as heart disease,
      diabetes, or previous surgeries to your insurance company is a grave
      mistake. This could lead to the non-payment of a benefit to your loved
      ones when they need it the most.

      Riders are extra features in life insurance for customization. Many
      overlook them and choose basic policies. Assess your needs to see if
      riders would be beneficial. Though they may raise premiums slightly, they
      provide valuable protection and financial benefits when needed.
