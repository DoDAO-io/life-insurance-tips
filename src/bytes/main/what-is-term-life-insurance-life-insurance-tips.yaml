      Term life insurance is a type of policy that provides a death benefit to
      the policyholder's beneficiaries for a specified period. Once the term
      ends, the policyholder can renew it, convert it into permanent coverage,
      or let it lapse.

      If you pass away during the policy term, the insurer will pay the policy's
      face value to your beneficiaries. This cash benefit is usually not taxable
      and can be used to cover healthcare and funeral costs, consumer debt,
      mortgage debt, and other expenses.

      Beneficiaries are not obligated to use the insurance proceeds to settle
      the deceased's debts. If the policy expires before your death or you live
      beyond the policy term, there is no payout.
