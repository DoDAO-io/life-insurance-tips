      premium structure and a cash value element, potentially offering cost

      However, there are risks associated with UL insurance. If your investments
      underperform or you underpay for too long, it could affect your death
      benefit or cause your policy to lapse.

      Universal life (UL) insurance premiums comprise two parts: the cost of
      insurance (COI) and the cash value. The COI is the essential payment to
      keep the policy active, covering mortality, policy administration, and
      associated expenses.

      COI will vary by policy based on the policyholderâ€™s age, insurability, and
      the insured risk amount. It's important to understand these factors when
      choosing a UL insurance policy.

      Premiums collected in excess of the cost of UL insurance accumulate within
      the cash value portion of the policy. If sufficient, the accumulated cash
      value can cover the increases in the COI, providing additional financial
      flexibility.
