      A rider is an insurance policy provision that adds benefits to or amends
      the terms of a basic insurance policy. Riders provide insured parties with
      options for additional coverage, or they may restrict or limit coverage.
      They can be added to policies that cover life, homes, autos, and rental
      units.

      Some policyholders have specific needs not covered by standard insurance
      policies, so riders help them create insurance products that meet those
      needs. Insurance companies offer supplemental insurance riders to
      customize policies by adding varying types of additional coverage.

      Buying an insurance rider is up to the insured party, who should weigh the
      cost against their individual needs. Although riders may sound appealing,
      they come at a costâ€”on top of the premiums for the policy itself.

      Certain homeowner insurance policies come with extra earthquake riders,
      but someone who doesn't live near a fault line probably doesn't need this
      additional coverage. Another thing to consider: a rider may duplicate
      coverage, so it's important to look over the basic insurance contract.
